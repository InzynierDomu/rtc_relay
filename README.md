## About

To config project for own needs You should change (in src/main.cpp):

```cpp
const DateTime m_start = DateTime(2000, 1, 1, 16, 48, 0); ///< time when realy turn on
const DateTime m_stop = DateTime(2000, 1, 1, 16, 50, 0); ///< time when realy turn off
```

From these two DateTime format yyyy, mm, dd, hh, mm, ss only hh, mm is important.
For this example relay turn in 16:48 and turn of in 16:50.
<br><br>
Setting the time is executing when the project is built and uploaded to the board with the connected RTC
<br><br>
If you want additional information delete ; in
paltformio.ini

```cpp
;build_flags = -D DEBUG
```

It isn't work for RTC_DS3231

## IDE

The project is prepared for the Platform IO environment. A video on how to install such an environment can be watched on this [video](https://youtu.be/Em9NuebT2Kc).
<br><br>
Formatting is executed using clang-format. The description of the tool configuration is in the [video](https://youtu.be/xxuaOG0WjIE).
<br><br>
The code contains a comment prepared for doxygen, their use is described in the [video](https://youtu.be/1YKJtrCsPD4).
